# Your network teacher provides you with this capture and asks you to try and find the files he has sent through your test lab.

aaaand that's how i got here. pcapng file.
after opening it in wireshark it's easy to notice that the dump has basically 3 main sections: first is NFS traffic, then there is also smb2 part and the last chunk is ftp. first guess: every one of these chunks contains one of three flags. 'SMB, FTP, NFS' line in challenge description hints that this guess might be true.

the easiest one to extract is smb flag. wireshark would gladly help: file - extract objects - smb2. i was able to extract 3 files frome there: one pdf whith a flag aaand... two dead ends. well, let's go further

the second one for me was ftp chunk. it's easy to see how data are transfered there. and that's where we get 3 more files. filenames like cat.jpg, cat2.png and cookie.txt can be seen throug the traffic.
