aaaand that's how i got here. pcapng file.
after opening it in wireshark it's easy to notice that the dump has basically 3 main sections: 
    - first is NFS traffic, 
    - then there is also smb2 part 
    - and the last chunk is ftp. 
first guess: every one of these chunks contains one of three flags. 
'SMB, FTP, NFS' line in challenge description hints that this guess might be true.

the easiest one to extract is smb flag. wireshark would gladly help: 
    file - extract objects - smb2. 
i was able to extract 3 files frome there: one pdf whith a flag aaand... 
two dead ends. well, let's go further

the second one for me was ftp chunk. it's easy to see how data are transfered there. and that's where we get 3 more files. 
filenames like cat.jpg, cat2.png and cookie.txt can be seen throug the traffic. one time i will insert here some more specific ftp descryption...
for now let's just keep in mind that what we need is files. fiiiiiles. so i filtred all the traffic by ftp-data. next step: extraction. finally.
for every file right click on package - follow tcp stream - show as raw - save as (filename). this way we get... 
    a picture of cat 
    second flag
    and 'keep trying' message
well. keep trying. last one...
NFS transmitts file in open. looking at offsets and length in packages, we are now able to recreate original file from parts. 
last package was tricky, declarating one data size and giving the other, but there is some pattern at the end of this part. 
repeating it at the end for file to be exactly the size it was said to be by NFS headers, i've gotten the third key. forgot to write NFS part when i did it so uhhh here it is now
